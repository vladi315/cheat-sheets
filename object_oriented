attribute self
Attribute self is used in method to receive the intstance of the class inside a method. Self is passed automatically to methods in python, but not received automatically. 

e.g.
  class food():

    # init method or constructor
    def __init__(self, fruit, color):
    self.fruit = fruit
    self.color = color

    def show(self):
    print("fruit is", self.fruit)
    print("color is", self.color )

    apple = food("apple", "red")
    grapes = food("grapes", "green")

    apple.show()
    grapes.show()
    
self.cache
